#Counting the chickens
print "I will now count my chickens:"
print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0
print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

#Counting the eggs
print "Now I will count the eggs:"
print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

# Verifying if one is greater than the other.
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7"
print 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0

# Basic Operations
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3.0 + 2.0
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5.0 - 7.0

print "Oh, that's why it's False."
print "How about some more."

# More complicated operations
print "Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
print "Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0
